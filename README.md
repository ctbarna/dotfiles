Chris Barna's Dotfiles
=============================
These are files to configure a shell just the way I like it. Most of the
configuration comes from [sferik](https://github.com/sferik/dotfiles)
but I have made a fair amount of changes.

Inspiration
-----------
These files are an amalgamation of wisdom Erik collected over the years,
the sources of which are too numerous to list. The idea to put them in a
repository with an install script was taken from [Ryan
Bates](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles).
