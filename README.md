Chris Barna's Dotfiles
======================
This repo was originally based on one from [sferik](https://github.com/sferik/dotfiles)
when I worked with him at Code for America. I've been steadily but poorly
maintaining it over the last few years. At this point, there isn't very much
left from his original repository except the inspiration.

Installation
------------
```
> git clone git@github.com:ctbarna/dotfiles.git
> cd dotfiles
> python install.py
```

This will symlink all the files in the repo that contain the suffix `.symlink`.
